## How To Run The Project

Create and activate a [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for your operating system and install the dependencies:

```bash
(.venv) $ python -m pip install -r <path_to_requirements.txt>
```

You can find the `requirements.txt` file in `source_code_setup/requirements.txt`.

Navigate to `source_code_final/` and start the Django development server:

```bash
(.venv) $ cd source_code_final
(.venv) $ python manage.py runserver
```

You can now navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser and inspect the finished project. You can also take a look at the project at certain steps as described in the associated tutorial.
